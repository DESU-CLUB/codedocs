## 🛠️ Setup Guide

1. **Download Dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have all the necessary packages by downloading from the **[requirements.txt](./codedocs/requirements.txt)** in the `codedocs` directory. We recommend using fast package installers like `uv` for Python.

2. **Install JavaScript Libraries**:  
   Navigate to the `documentation_app` folder and run the following command to install the required JavaScript libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Add API Keys**:  
   Open the `.env` file and add your GROQ and Relevance AI API keys. These are essential for the app's functionality.

4. **Run the Application**:  
   - **Backend**: Navigate to the root directory and start the Flask app:
     ```bash
     python3 start_app.py
     ```
   - **Frontend**: Move to the `documentation_app` folder and start the React app:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## 💡 Inspiration

Our project is inspired by the engaging puzzles created by [Sascha Rush](https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles). We love the interactive way these puzzles teach new code and concepts. Our goal is to bring this interactive learning style to various types of documentation and libraries.
